# Pizza Site

This is the 3rd project in Harvard's CS50W Course Intro to Web Programming with Python and Javascript!
It utilizes the Python Webframework Django to create a simple Pizza Shop Website!
The website allows users to view a menu, add items to the menu, and place and view their orders.
An admin can view and manage the orders and menu items through an admin website provided by Django.

Future functionality includes:
  
  1. Allowing admins to view orders through the website instead of the admin website
  
  2. Allowing admins to mark orders as complete
  
  3. Improving the menu UI
